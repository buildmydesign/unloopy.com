Privacy Policy for Unloopy
Last updated: December 1, 2024
Introduction
Unloopy ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we safeguard it when you use the Unloopy mobile application (the "App").
Unloopy is a digital wellbeing app that helps you limit distracting apps using usage limits, schedules, and time-saved insights.
________________________________________
Information We Collect
1. App Usage & Blocking Data
To provide distraction-blocking functionality, we collect:
•	App Usage Statistics: How long each app is used.
•	App Identifiers (Package Names): The specific apps you choose to block (required to enforce your blocking rules).
•	Session Metadata: Session start and end times, durations, and whether a session was blocked.
•	Blocking Events: When an app was blocked based on your configured limits or schedules.
•	Time Saved Metrics: Calculated time saved due to blocking.
This data is used strictly for enforcing your settings and displaying usage insights.

2. Technical Data
We collect limited technical information to improve performance:
•	Device information (e.g., model, Android version)
•	App performance and crash logs
Collected through Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics.
This technical data is anonymous and used only for diagnostics.

•	Backup schedules and session metadata for reinstalls
We do NOT use your data for advertising, profiling, or selling to third parties.
